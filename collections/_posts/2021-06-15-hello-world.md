# Hello world!

- Project created on GitHub
- Initial [project page](https://hidapter.github.io) created
    - First contact with Jekyll
        - Used the [Just the docs](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs) theme
            - Limited navigation support, temporarily using [an improved branch](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs/pull/448)
        - Using [includes as functions](http://hamishwillee.github.io/2014/11/13/jekyll-includes-are-functions/)
        - [Jekyll cheatsheet](https://cloudcannon.com/community/jekyll-cheat-sheet/) is so useful!
    - Created the site structure with stubs for some connectors and protocols
